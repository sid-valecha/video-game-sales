# Video Game Sales Data and Ratings Exploration

In this project, I created a Shiny application to visualize and explore video game sales data. The
dataset includes information about game titles, platforms, release years, genres, and critic/user
scores. The goal of this app is to allow users to analyze the sales distribution and trends in video
games across regions, as well as compare critic and user scores across different genres.
The interface was designed to give users maximum flexibility in interacting with the data,
providing a wide variety of filtering options and multiple visualizations. This allows users to
explore the data from multiple perspectives and discover trends in video game performance,
reviews, and sales over time.
